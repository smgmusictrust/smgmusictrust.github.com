                        <strong>Smt.Mangalam Ganapathy Music Trust</strong>
                        (M.G.M.T) was founded on 22

                        July, 2002 with objectives linked to Music, Dance, Fine Arts and cultural  events and activities. It is a non-profit organisation dedicated to propagate  and popularize compositions of various composers in general and those of a  prodigious and divine composer Smt.Mangalam Ganapathy, in particular.

                            The Compositions are perceptible and aesthetic. Prasam and yati prasam are handled well in the compositions. The ragas chosen are not only traditional but also suitable to the mood of the compositions. I am sure the compositions will withstand test of time.

                        It is nothing short of a  miracle that Smt.Mangalam Ganapathy belonging to an average middle class family  background with no formal association with any form of music or dance began  composing songs on various deities during August 1998 at an unusual age of 64  years. In nine years of time since then, she has literally poured out more than  six thousand compositions on all accepted deities in many languages that are  known as well as unknown to her. She has to her credit, compositions in Tamil, Sanskrit,  Malayalam, Telugu and Hindi.

                            She can claim a place among better composers because of the fact that she had been authoress of not only the words but also the tunes of the song. The music is catchy and respectable throughout and the lyric is matching well

                            I have gone through the compositions of Smt.Mangalam Ganapathy. The songs have been composed in Rakti Ragas which are easy to sing. The words are also simple.
