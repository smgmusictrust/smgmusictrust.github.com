                    <p align="justify">
                        <strong>Smt.Mangalam Ganapathy</strong>
                        was  born in 1934 in an orthodox middle class family at Kallidaikurichi, in  Tirunelveli district among seven children. Her father Sri.M.S.Subramania Iyer  was a teacher in Thilakar Vidyalayam High School. He was also a writer of  textbooks in Science &amp; Social Studies. Besides he translated Tolstoy&rsquo;s  stories into Tamil which were prescribed as a non-detailed study for school  children.

                        <p align="justify" class="p3">
                            An in depth perusal of the compositions of Smt. Mangalam Ganapathy left an indelible impression on me and I have no hesitation whatsoever in concluding that her compositions deserve to be classified amongst the finest ones of the present era. Having heard her render some compositions, she is indeed a vaggeyakara of a unique genre.

                    </div>
                    <p align="justify">
                        During her childhood, she did not have  any formal education in carnatic music. Tamil was her mother tongue. She learnt  from her father devotional hymns and Sanskrit slokas. But she would always be  listening to her elder sisters singing who were learning music from Vidwan Sri  Appaiah Bhagavathar, a disciple of Sri Muthiah Bhagavathar of  Harikesanallur.&nbsp; She got married in the  year 1954 and moved to Tiruvananthapuram where she stayed for almost 45 years.  She picked up a working knowledge of Malayalam during her stay there. Household  chores and family responsibilities consumed most of her time.

                    <p align="justify">
                        It all happened while in Madras in  August 1998 when they were about to perform Ganapthy pooja and Devi pooja at  their residence. Suddenly she started feeling the presence of elevated thoughts  and in that sublime mood she composed a song &ldquo;<em>Mahaganapathim Upasmahe</em>&rdquo; in Nattaikurinji on Lord Ganesha and  followed it up by another song &ldquo;<em>Amba  Krupasagari</em>&rdquo; in Kalyani on Devi. She does not know how it happened but the  songs were rendered with appropriate tala. 
                    </p>
                    <p align="justify">
                        She has since then composed more than  6000 songs in three and a half years and that too in five different languages  like Sanskrit, Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi and Telugu. It is only divine grace that  she is able to write in languages other than Tamil and Malayalam because she never  had any chance to learn them. She has written from Varnams (both thana and  padha), Keerthanas, Ragamalika, Thillana and devotional bhajans. She has sung  on all Hindu deities that too exceeding 100s on each deity and their  incarnations and also a few philosophical and patriotic compositions too. In  fact a good musician can perform a full concert from Varnam to Mangalam from  her compositions with a variety to choose from raga, tala, the genre, the deity  and the language. What do we call this other than a divine musical miracle?

                            While editing her songs I was amazed at their simplicity, spontaneity, devotional fervour and diction. An ordinary housewife, aged 64, suddenly bursts forth into song and not only krithis, but also varnams, ragamalikas and thillanas come gushing out in hundreds. What is mind-boggling is that she has had no formal training in music and has never heard the ragas in which she was composing. More intriguing is the fact that she composes songs in languages like Telugu and Hindi with which she is not acquainted.

                    <p align="justify">
                        With encouragement from  musicians and musicologists of eminence, like Sri Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer,  Smt.D.K.Pattammal, Sri A.S.Panchapakesa Iyer, Smt.Mani Krishnaswamy,  Smt.Rukmini Ramani, Dr.V.V.Srivatsa and Kallidaikurichi Mahadeva Bhagavathar,  two books titled &ldquo;Mangala Geetham Vol.I &amp; II containing 81 keerthanas and  an audio cassette covering 12 songs were released in October 1999. It must be  mentioned of the great help given by Dr.Rukmini Ramani and Sri A.S Panchapakesa  Iyer in notating the songs, as Mangalam does not have any formal education in  music.&nbsp; 
                    </p>
                    <p align="justify">
                        Besides the above, other  luminaries of carnatic music like Sri.T.R.Subramaniam, Sri.T.K.GovindaRao,  Sri.T.S.Parthasarathy, Sri.K.S.Mahadevan, Sri.Lalgudi.G.Jayaraman, Smt.R.Vedavalli,  Sri.P.S.Narayanaswamy, Sri.R.Krishnaswamy, Sri.S.R.Janakiraman,  Sri.Ramachandriah, Sri Vaidyanatha Krishnan, Sri.Sivaramakrishnan,  Sri.O.S.Thyagarajan, Sikkil sisters and Dr.Prameela Gurumurthy have written forewords  to the five volumes of books so far released.

                    <p align="justify">
                        And on 31st May 2002, a  book, the third volume of &ldquo;<em>Mangala  Geetham</em>&rdquo; containing 101 songs notated by Dr.Mrs.Rukmini Ramani along with  the second and third volume of audio cassettes rendered by Mambalam sisters  were released at a function held at Asthika Samajam, Alwarpet.&nbsp; Since then another two volumes of book being  Volume 4 &amp; 5 each containing 101 songs and 7 audio cassettes and compact  discs have been released by the Trust formed in her name.

                        As part of the activities  of the trust, for the propagation of her compositions, music teachers are  encouraged to teach them to their pupils and the trust provides the teachers with  books and audio cassettes free of cost. At frequent intervals, an opportunity  is offered to the teachers to present a programme of these compositions through  their students. During July 2006, Smt.Chthra Madhavan, one of the music  teachers presented a programme titled &ldquo;<em>Sata  Mangala Lahari</em>&rdquo;&nbsp; where her students  rendered 101 compositions.&nbsp; Now having  seen this programme, many of the teachers want to do it on an annual basis.
